PHP Assignment: Develop an Air Ticketing System (customer and administration) based on AirAsia

This is a group project done by 4 people in December 2020 for college assignment. This is just a reupload version.
This system covers both customer interface and a staff management interface. The frontend is mainly developed with Bootstrap and backend is developed with PHP.
This project aims to recreate an air ticketing system based on Air Asia. This is not an official or a replication of Air Asia air ticketing system.
